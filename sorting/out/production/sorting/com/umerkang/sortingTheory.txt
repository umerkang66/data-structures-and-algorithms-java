BUBBLE SORT:
In every step you are comparing the adjacent elements, if second element is larger than
the first element, then swap it. It is also known as sinking sort, exchange sort
At every step, the largest element from an unsorted array will come to the end, hence
form will form sorting from the end. Hence should not be comparing the sorted part of the
array.
