        // What is Recursion: Function calling itself, with a base condition
        // Why Recursion: It helps us in solving bigger/complex problems in a simple way

        // 1) We can convert the recursion solutions into iteration and vice versa
        // 2) First solve using recursion, then convert it into iteration for
        // optimization, because directly solving into iteration is difficult
        // 3) Space complexity is not constant. O(n)
        // 4) When you write the recursion process into a formula, it is known as
        // recurrence relation

        // How to Approach the recursive problem
        // 1) Identify if we can break the problem into smaller problems
        // 2) Write the recurrence relation if needed
        // 3) Draw the recursive tree
        // 4) About the tree:
        //      a) See the flow of functions how they are getting in stack
        //      b) Identify and focus on left tree calls, and right tree calls
        //      c) Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper
        //      d) Use the debugger to see the flow
        // 5) See the values are returned at each step, see where the function call
        // will come out of, In the end you will come of the main function

        // Variables
        // 1) Arguments
        // 2) Return Type
        // 3) Body of a function

        // Types of Recurrence Relations
        // Linear recurrence relations --> fibonacci
        // Divide and conquer recurrence relations --> binary search
